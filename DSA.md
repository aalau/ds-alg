# Data Structures and Algorithms needed as a software engineer

## [Arrays]():

Functions: Insertion, deletion, searching, sorting (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort), binary search, reversing, finding the maximum/minimum element.

## [Linked Lists]():

Functions: Insertion (at the beginning, middle, end), deletion, searching, traversal, reversing, detecting a cycle, finding the middle element.

## [Stacks and Queues]():

Stack Functions: Push, pop, peek, checking for empty stack.
Queue Functions: Enqueue, dequeue, peek, checking for an empty queue.
Algorithms: Implementing a stack and queue using arrays or linked lists, circular queue, evaluating expressions.

## [Trees]():
